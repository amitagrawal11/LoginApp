# LoginApp

For AngularJS practice, implementing the following use cases:
-> Create a form with 2 fields - Username and password and Submit button.
-> Submit button should be enabled when there is some input in both the fields.
-> On Click of submit button, bring the control to service and use callback functions for returning success and error from service based on some rule i.e. if Username contains special character, make use of callback function for passing error back to controller and update the UI with generic message.
-> If Password contains special character, throw error and display error on UI using error handler. 
-> If both the rules pass, return success through callback function and display success message on UI.
-> Call callback function after waiting 3 seconds.
